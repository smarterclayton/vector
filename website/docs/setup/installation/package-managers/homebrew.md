As shown in the diagram above, the daemon deployment strategy is designed for
data collection on a single host. Vector is deplyed in it's own container,
collecting and forwarding all data on the host.

## Configuring

The Vector configuration file is placed in:

```text
/usr/local/etc/vector/vector.toml
```

A full spec is located at `/usr/local/etc/vector/vector.spec.toml` and examples
are located in `/usr/local/etc/vector/examples/*`. You can learn more about
configuring Vector in the [Configuration][docs.configuration] section.

## Deploying

How you deploy Vector is largely dependent on your use case and environment.
Please see the [deployment section][docs.deployment] for more info on how to
deploy Vector.

## Administering

Vector can be managed through the [Homebrew services][urls.homebrew_services]
manager:

<Jump to="/docs/administration">Administration</Jump>

## Uninstalling

```bash
brew remove vector
```

## Updating

```bash
brew update && brew upgrade vector
```

## Package

### Architectures

Vector's Homebrew packages only support the X86_64 arhcitecture.

### Versions

Historical Vector versions can be found in the [releases][urls.vector_releases].
Once you've found the version you'd like to install you can specify it with:

```bash
brew install vector@X.X.X
```

Due to limitations of Homebrew, Vector cannot pin specific major or minor
versions. If this is a requirement, then we recommend installing Vector
directly [from an archive][docs.manual.from-archives].

### Source Files

Vector's Homebrew source files are located in
[Vector's brew repo][urls.vector_homebrew_source_files].

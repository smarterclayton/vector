## How We'll Do It

To send Journald logs to GCP Cloud Storage (GCS) _properly_, and accomplish all of the items above,
we'll use [Vector][urls.vector_website] and deploy it as a
daemon.

### First, We'll Use Vector

<SVG src="/img/components.svg" width="80%" className="margin-vert--lg" />

Written in [Rust][urls.rust], [Vector][urls.vector_website] is a lightweight
and ultra-fast tool for building observability pipelines. Compared to Logstash
and friends, Vector [improves throughput by ~10X while significanly reducing
CPU and memory usage][urls.vector_performance] and it's the perfect tool for
this task.

### Second, We'll Deploy Vector As A Daemon

<SVG src="/img/deployment-strategies-docker-daemon.svg" />

As shown in the diagram above, the daemon deployment strategy is designed for
data collection on a single host. Vector is deplyed in it's own container,
collecting and forwarding all data on the host.

## A Simple Step-By-Step Tutorial

<div className="steps steps--h3">

<ol>
<li>

### Install Vector

<InstallationCommand />

</li>
<li>

### Configure Vector

<ConfigExample
  format="toml"
  path="vector.toml"
  sourceName={"journald"}
  sinkName={"gcp_cloud_storage"} />

</li>
<li>

### Start Vector

```bash
vector --config vector.toml
```

That's it! Simple and to the point. Hit `ctrl+c` to exit.
